System Philosophy & Core Constraints
A banking system is not a standard CRUD app. It has three non-negotiable requirements:

Financial Data Integrity: You cannot lose or miscalculate a transaction.

Regulatory Readiness: Audit logs, idempotency, and data immutability.


Third-Party Liability: You are handling real money via Plaid/Dwolla/Paystack; security is contractual.
