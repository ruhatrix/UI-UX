1. Asethetic-usability effect
   💠users often percevie aesthetically pleasing design as design that's more usable
2. Doherty threshold
  💠 Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace(<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other

4. Hick's law
  💠the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices
5. Jakob's law
  💠users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

   💠elements tend to be preceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.
7. Law of pragnanz
   💠people will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us.
8. Law of proximity
    💠objects that are near or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.
9. Law of similarity
    💠the human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape or group, even if those elements are separated.

    💠the average person can only keep 7(plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.
12. Occam's Razor
     💠among competing hyotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.
13. Pareto Principle 
     💠the pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
14. Parkinson's law
    💠 any task inflate until all of the available time is spent.
15. postel's law
     💠 Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.
16. Serial position effect
    💠users have a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series.
17. Tesler's law 
    💠 tesler's law, also known as the law of conservation of complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.
18. Von Restorff Effect
    💠 The von restorff effect, also known as the isolation effect, predict that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differ from the rest is most likely to be remembered.
19. Zeigarnik effect
   💠people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.
describing and knowing this concepts really make you a good designer


The Psychology of Perception (How Users See)
These laws explain how the human brain automatically organizes visual information.

Law of Proximity & Common Region: Put related things closer together or inside the same container (a card, a shaded box). Your brain instantly sees them as a group, reducing clutter. Think: Form fields grouped in a box.

Law of Similarity: Make elements that behave the same look the same (color, shape, size). Users will instantly understand their function. Think: All blue, underlined text = clickable links.

Law of Prägnanz (Simplicity): Your brain craves the simplest interpretation. Use clear, recognizable icons and shapes. Avoid unnecessary visual complexity. Think: A "hamburger" menu icon (≡) is not inherently simple, but it's become a recognizable pattern.

Fitts' Law: The bigger and closer a target is, the faster and easier it is to hit. Make clickable buttons large and place key actions near the user's natural resting point (e.g., a "Submit" button near the form fields). Think: Giant "Add to Cart" buttons on mobile.

The Psychology of Decision & Interaction (How Users Choose & Act)
These principles guide how you present choices and manage user effort.

Hick's Law: More choices = more time to decide. Break complex tasks into simple steps, limit menu items, and use good defaults. Don't overwhelm. Think: A wizard (step-by-step form) instead of one massive page.

Jakob's Law: Users bring expectations from other sites. Follow established conventions (shopping cart icon, magnifying glass for search). Don't reinvent the wheel unless you have a radically better solution.

Doherty Threshold & Parkinson's Law: Provide instant feedback (<400ms) for actions (like button clicks) to keep users engaged and productive. Also, set sensible constraints (e.g., character limits, progress indicators) to prevent tasks from ballooning. Think: A loading animation tells the user the system is working.

Postel's Law (Robustness Principle): Be forgiving with inputs. Accept different date formats, autocorrect minor typos, and show clear, helpful error messages when something goes wrong. Make your system resilient.

The Psychology of Memory & Attention (What Users Remember)
These effects predict what will stick in the user's mind.

Serial Position Effect & Von Restorff Effect: People remember the first and last items best, and anything that stands out. Place key actions at the beginning or end of lists, and use visual contrast (color, size) for the most important option. Think: A prominent "Premium" plan in a pricing table.

Miller's Law: The working memory limit is ~7±2 items. Chunk information into groups of 5-9 items max. Don't show 20 menu items at once. *Think: A phone number is chunked as (555) 123-4567.*

Zeigarnik Effect: People remember unfinished tasks. Use progress trackers, to-do lists with unchecked items, or "Continue Watching" sections to encourage users to return and complete actions.
Foundational Mindset Principles (Your Design Philosophy)
These are overarching truths that shape your approach to problem-solving.

Aesthetic-Usability Effect: A beautiful design is forgiven for minor usability issues and perceived as easier to use. Invest in visual polish—it builds trust and satisfaction.

Occam's Razor: The simplest solution is usually the right one. When faced with two designs that work equally well, choose the one with fewer elements, steps, or complexity.

Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule): Focus your effort on the 20% of features/design fixes that will solve 80% of the user problems. Prioritize ruthlessly.

Tesler's Law (Conservation of Complexity): Complexity in a system is constant. You can't magic it away; you can only move it from the user to the system (through smart automation) or the designer (through clever design). The user's burden should always be minimized.

In short, knowing these concepts makes you a good designer because they:

Move you from opinion to reason. You can justify why a button should be bigger or a list shorter.

Help you predict user behavior. You can design with an understanding of how people will naturally perceive and interact with your work.

Provide a shared language. You can communicate effectively with team members and stakeholders using proven principles, not just taste.

Make your designs more intuitive and humane. You're designing for the human brain, not just for the screen.

It’s the difference between decorating and engineering the user experience.
